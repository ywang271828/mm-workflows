dependencies:
# pypy is ~2X faster than the regular python interpreter.
# We need to install it first so the dependency solver installs it bundled with python 3.9
# (pypy is not yet compatible with 3.10 and 3.11)
# pypy should be removed when building wic api docker image
  - pypy
  - "python<3.10"
  - shellcheck
# wget and zip cause errors in the setup-miniconda github action on windows.

# NOTE: Although wic doesn't have an explicit dependency on numpy, several
# issues arise when numpy is installed as a transitive dependency of matplotlib.
# On linux and macos, using pip to install numpy may cause this error with pytest:
# "Fatal Python error: Illegal instruction"
# So we need to explicitly install numpy using conda.
  - numpy
# The psutil install guide claims that precompiled binary wheels are available,
# and that it isn't necessary to install compilers. This does not appear to be
# correct, so install psutil with conda/mamba so we don't have to install compilers.
