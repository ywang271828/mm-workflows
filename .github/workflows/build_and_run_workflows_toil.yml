# NOTE: For some reason, running the workflows with toil-cwl-runner takes
# almost exactly twice as much time as cwltool. Since we do not want to triple
# our CI time on every push, for now let's just run toil-cwl-runner separately
# every weekday at midnight.

on:
  # push:  # Do NOT run toil-cwl-runner on every push!
  # pull_request: (either on origin or on upstream pull request)
  schedule:
  # Instead, run it every weekday at midnight.
